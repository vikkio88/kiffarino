# kiffarino/kfr

Kiffarino is a lightweight, local-first project management tool built for developers and small teams who prefer a simple, CLI and Web based workflow tracking tool.

It lets you manage tasks, tickets, and projects directly within your project folder — no complex setups, cloud services, or external tools required.

Just fast, minimal, local productivity.

It's like Jira, but simple and it just works.

Loosely based on another side project of mine: [kiffari](https://github.com/vikkio88/kiffari).

> Kiffari: from sicilian (Aju) Chiffari = I've got stuff to do.

## ✨ Features

- 🗃️ **Local-first ticket and task management** — Everything is stored locally in plain files, no cloud required.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g kiffarino
```

**Help**
Displays a list of available commands and usage information.

```bash
kfr help
```

**Init**

Initializes your project by creating a .kfrc configuration file.
Use this file to define the path to your ticket/document folder and basic project settings.

```bash
kfr init
```

**Generate**

Generates the necessary folder structure for your ticket system, based on the .kfrc config.

```bash
kfr generate
```

**Start**

Starts the Kiffarino server locally.
By default, it runs on port 3003. You can specify a different port like this:

```bash
kfr start # <- will start the server on port 3003
kfr start 5321 # <- will start the server on port 5321
```
